        <br>
        <p class="is-size-5">SEETA i.e. Society for Environmental Education and Technical Awareness is an NGO under
          which Gurukul Academy was established on 1st of July 2008 in order to uplift the lower middle class families
          children by providing them quality education. The main visionary behind this concept was late Shrimati Seeta
          Devi ji Neekhra and late Shri Ramnarayan ji Neekhra the founder president of the SEETA.</p>

            We at Gurukul Academy believe that the kid is born with lots of excellencies and with this vision we strive
            to respect the unique individuality of each child, give the child the right kind of help. We believe that a
            child will be successful in life if we accept him/her as they are and inspire them to become what they want
            to become.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            We give lot of importance to make discipline a core value, encourage students to develop a sense of
            responsibility through a well planned academic schedule, House system, various Inter School, Intra School
            competitions and Sports activities. We expect them to do the same at home too like making the beds, keeping
            the rooms tidy, helping and supporting the family members in the daily chores etc.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <p class="is-size-5">The school has a well-planned curriculum so that co-curricular activities also are given
            due importance. The parents should ensure that their ward is actively involved in all activities.
            Finally I want to assure you that the Management and our team of teachers are doing their best to give your
            child the required edge to make his/her mark in this global world.</p>
